There are literally hundreds of APIs that you can pull from that use ```POST``` or ```PUT``` requests. [This page has a good starter list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). Many of the edtech tools you may use in school have RESTful APIs as well.
 
Your assignment this week is as follows to use an API to send or store data:
* Create a new page on your site, add to an existing page, or click "Fork" at the bottom of [this CodePen template](https://codepen.io/mjsamberg/pen/oNBWJOm)
* Use a public API to display data on your site. The data may be static, or you may collect user input. **DO NOT use any API that exposes private data (the Canvas API might, for example) and DO NOT enter a credit card number in any API signups.**
* Submit the URL for your assignment in Moodle.
