There are literally hundreds of APIs that you can pull from that use ```GET``` requests. [This page has a good starter list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). Look for the ones that use no authentication or an API key and read the specifications to ensure they use a ```GET``` request. Many of the edtech tools you may use in school have RESTful APIs as well.
 
Your assignment this week is as follows:
* Create a new page on your site, add to an existing page, or click "Fork" at the bottom of [this CodePen template](https://codepen.io/mjsamberg/pen/oNBWJOm)
* Use a public API to display data on your site. The data may be static, or you may collect user input. **DO NOT use any API that exposes private data (the Canvas API might, for example) and DO NOT enter a credit card number in any API signups.**
* Submit the URL for your assignment in Moodle.
