Your assignment for this week is to do the following:

* Create a new page on your website (or you may add to an existing page if you choose to do so). This page may or may not be linked to the rest of your site if it is not going to be part of your site.
* Add in jQuery 
* Create at least two interactive elements using jQuery. Interactive means that a user should trigger the action. One should hide or show content, and the other should display text to the user based on their input. You may use any of the activities I've already shared as a starting point and you may use additional JavaScript libraries if you choose.
* In WolfWare, submit the URL to your new page.
