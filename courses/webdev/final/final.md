## Final Project
As you're aware by now, your website is your final project. The website must have multiple pages (there is no set limit, but at least two) and one interactive element created using JavaScript. 

In WolfWare, submit the URL of the website you want graded for your project.

The project will be worth five points and will be graded as follows:

* 1 point: The site includes valid and [clean](https://mjsamberg.github.io/courses/webdev/design/refactor/refactor.html) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* 1 point: The site includes at least one element that is interactive and controlled by JavaScript. This element may be anything we've learned in the class, but it should be more than a "show/hide" and it must make sense in the context of your site.
* 1 point: The site adheres to accessibility checks and passes checks in the WAVE editor.
* 2 points: The site contains thoughtful content, is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and adheres to principles of good design.
