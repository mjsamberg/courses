The site you've created so far exists in a class-level GitHub account. It will be archived at the end of the course and will become inaccessible. While we've done some basic work in GitHub, there are [so many features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) that we've yet to explore. While GitHub's primary use is for hosting source code for full-stack applications (front-end applications, back-end services, and combinations of both), it also can be used as a free way to host front-end websites as we have been doing this semester. 

### Important note about naming repositories
By default, your repository will have the URL ```http://[username].github.io/[repository_name]```. You can set GitHub to automatically set a website to be your default website at ```http://[username].github.io``` by naming your repository ```[username.github.io]``` (for example, mine would be ```mjsamberg.github.io```). That means that users would need a subdirectory to get to that site. 

## Purchasing a Domain Name
In addition to a ```github.io``` URL, you can buy your own domain name (```myawesomeeci519website.com```) and use it for GitHub with no additional charges beyond the purchase of the domain name (generally around $15/year). In the GitHub pages setup, you can specify your custom domain to be used and then head over to a site like [Google Domains](https://domains.google) or [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) to purchase your domain name. Once you purchase the domain name, you have to add the records to point the domain name to GitHub Pages ([Instructions for Google Domains](https://dev.to/trentyang/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages-1p58)).

## Other Hosting Options
Other sites, like GoDaddy offer hosting options as well. If you want to host there, simply follow the instructions to upload your site files to those sites.
