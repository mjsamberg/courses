This week we will be continuing with our website design from last week. 

## Instructions
* Add the following items:
	* A second page with additional content of your choice (create a new HTML file in your site by right-clicking in your files list and selecting "new File")
	* At least two links: one that's relative (between your two pages) and at least one to an external website (the easiest thing is to link to your list of edtech tools).
	* At least one image.
* Save this file, commit it to GitHub and push your changes. Use "HTML Week 2 Assignment" somewhere in your commit message.
* In Moodle, go to the assignment for the week and check the box that it has been completed.
